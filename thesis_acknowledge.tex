The achievement of this thesis is thanks to the help and contribution
of many people involved and I do my best to credit every single one of
them.

First of all, I am obliged to pay my tribute to my professor, Günther
Dissertori, for according me the great opportunity as a PhD student in
physics at the ETH Zürich even though I came from an engineering
background. The discussions, the support and guidance at any time
despite his very busy schedule is very appreciated.

I acknowledge with thanks Dominik Dannheim, as my supervisor at CERN,
for following my work during three years with high-precision and a lot
of patience and showing me your excellence in guiding of the research
project on the vertex detector R\&D.

All my gratitude also goes to Lucie Linssen, as the group leader of
the EP-LCD group, who gave me various opportunities to work at her
dynamic and creative group at CERN and for convincing all the
above-mentioned supervisors to accept me as a PhD student.

I would like to thank the EP-LCD group in general for their
contribution to my work and also all the lunches, coffee breaks and
social activities shared. More particularly, I express my gratitude
to:

\begin{itemize}
\item Andreas Nurnberg, who always was present for guiding me,
  answering my questions, discussing my results and all his help
  without which the carrying of this project would have not been
  possible.
\item Daniel Hynds and Adrian Fiergolski for the various discussions
  and test-beams we have shared.
\item Mathieu Benoît for introducing me to the pixel world through
  test-beams, TCAD simulations and AllPix simulations.
\item Rosa Simoniello, for sharing the office and all the discussions,
  work-related or personal and the laughs we have shared.
\end{itemize}

I would like to thank my friends with whom I have shared so many
memorable moments and I could count on them for any kind of support
even though lately I was not really present due to the work load. My
friends from Lausanne that I met during my studies at EPFL and we
shared many years on the university benches and now we share so many
great dinners, brunches: Charlotte, Chloé, Christophe, Coralie, Lara,
Mina, Salim and Sebastien. And to my friends I have met at CERN:
Elena, Enrico, Luca, Milena, Myriam for the shared lunches,
discussions or nights out.

Finally, I would like to thank my amazing family: my parents,
Mahmanzar and Behzad, for their unconditional love and support
throughout all my life, for all their sacrifices without which I could
not imagine where I would be now. My beloved sister and housemate,
Yassaman, for always being present, encouraging me and tolerating me
during the times I was low (basically the whole year of 2016). My
little smart brother, Alireza, for being who he is and always making
me laugh with his funny stories.
