% The aim of the CLIC vertex detector is the precise determination of
% the displaced vertices and jet flavour-tagging in an environment with
% high occupancy from beam-induced backgrounds. Multi-layer barrel and
% endcap pixel detectors with geometrical coverage extending down to low
% polar angles ($\theta_{min}\sim8^{\circ}$) are foreseen to fulfill
% these requirements. The goal is to achieve a single-point resolution
% of $\sim 3\,\micron$ with $25\,\micron$ pixel pitch and analogue
% readout. A material budget of $\sim0.2\%$~X\textsubscript{0} per layer
% is required including readout, support and cabling. This can be
% achieved with $50\,\micron$ thick sensors on $50\,\micron$ thick
% readout ASICs.

As part of the R\&D programme for the CLIC vertex detector, the
performance of thin silicon sensors is quantified using the Timepix3
readout chip with $55\,\micron$ pixel pitch. $50\,\micron$ to
$150\,\micron$ thick planar sensors are bump-bonded to $750\,\micron$
thick Timepix3 ASICs. These assemblies are tested in test beams using
the CLICdp Timepix3 telescope.

The AllPix simulation framework (described in \cref{sec:AllPix}) is
used to simulate the performance of thin sensors and to understand the
charge sharing in such sensors. A digitiser is designed in AllPix
which simulates the sensor and the readout ASIC. Data are used to
validate the simulations. The simulation is finally extrapolated to
predict the spatial resolution for smaller pixels of $25\,\micron$
pitch which is aimed to be achieved for the CLIC vertex detector.

\section{Thin-sensor assemblies}
A summary of thin sensors ($50-150\,\micron$ thick) bump-bonded to
Timepix3 readout ASICs is shown in
\cref{tab:Timepix3Assemblies}. These assemblies are tested using the
CLICdp Timepix3 pixel-beam reference telescope at the CERN SPS with
the experimental setup as described in \cref{sec:CERN_SPS}.

%% --------------------------------------------- %%
\subsection{Operating conditions}
\label{sec:operatingConditions}
The Timepix3 readout ASICs were operated with the optimised parameters
as described in \cref{tab:timepix3Operation}. The nominal values for
the threshold and the bias voltage are shown in
\cref{tab:nominalBiasThreshold}. For the nominal bias voltage, the
sensor is fully (or over) depleted. The nominal threshold set, insures
that the readout chip is not operating in noisy
conditions. \cref{sec:operatingThreshold} describes the procedure for
the selection of the nominal threshold value. These nominal values are
held throughout the data taking except for the cases where the
threshold or the bias voltages are scanned.

\section{Calibrated test beam data}
\label{sec:calibrated_test_beam_data}

The test pulse calibration as described in
\cref{sec:EnergyCalibration} is applied to the test beam data in order
to convert the TOT values into energy deposited by the MIP particles
in units of the number of electrons generated.


\cref{sec:testBeamDataCalibrated_TOT} shows the TOT distribution for
one, two, three and four-pixel clusters. The MPV of the TOT
distributions for different cluster sizes do not align due to the
non-linear behaviour of the Timepix3, as sharing the same deposited
charge amongst several pixels results in each pixel having a higher
TOT than would be expected from simply scaling the charge. The
calibrated energy distribution aligns for different cluster sizes
since the calibration takes into account the non-linearities of the
chip as shown in \cref{sec:testBeamDataCalibrated_Edep}. For the
$50\,\micron$ thick sensor, the calibrated distributions do not align
since higher deposited energies tend to give higher cluster sizes and
the distributions for larger cluster sizes are biased towards larger
energy depositions.

\section{Experimental and simulated results for thin sensors}

This section gives an overview on the performance of thin sensors. The
AllPix simulations of thin sensors are validated using test-beam data.

%% --------------------------------------------- %%
\subsection{Measurement of the depletion voltage}
\label{sec:ThinSensors_depletionVoltage}

The depletion voltage corresponds to the voltage at which the sensor
is fully depleted and the charge of the full thickness of the sensor
is collected. This can be measured in test beams by scanning the bias
voltage. For lower bias voltages the sensor is under depleted and
therefore the collected charge is also reduced. The depletion voltage
and the sensor thickness are related by \cref{eq:depletionVoltage}.

To obtain the depletion voltage, frist, the distribution of the
deposited energy in the sensor is fitted with a landau function
convoluted with a Gaussian. The fit is done using
RooFit~\cite{Cranmer:2012sba} and an example is given in
\cref{fig:W5_F1_DepletionVoltage_TOTdistr}.
\cref{fig:W2_J5_DepletionVoltage_chargeVSbiasVoltage} shows the most
probable value (MPV) of the measured energy deposition as a function
of the square root of the bias voltage. In this figure, two distinct
regions can be seen: a sloped region and a plateau region. The
depletion voltage of the assembly is obtained by calculating the
intersection of a linear fit performed on both regions (defined by
eye). The calculated depletion voltages for all assemblies is
summarised in \cref{tab:depletionVoltage,fig:depletionVoltage}. The
$50\,\micron$ thick sensor is depleted at a low bias voltage of
$\sim$2~V. However the measurement was done with a voltage step size
of $1$~V and the fits give a higher depletion voltage of $\sim7$~V.

From the depletion voltage, the concentration of the dopants in the
bulk is calculated to be around
$N_{bulk}\approx1.3\,\inversemetercubic$ and corresponds to a
resistivity of $\rho\approx10\,\text{k}\Omega\,\text{cm}$ for all the
assemblies.

%% --------------------------------------------- %%
\subsection{Cluster size distribution}
The cluster size distribution is an indication on the amount of charge
sharing in a sensor. For thicker sensors, more charge sharing is
expected since the charge drifts in a longer distance and diffuses
across a larger transverse area. The threshold of the readout
electronics has a large impact on the detection of the charge
sharing. The threshold should be as low as possible to avoid
undetected energy deposits.

In this analysis, the hit pixels form a cluster with a distance
criterion of $\sqrt{2}$: pixels sharing common corners or edges are
considered as clusters. For sensor thicknesses in the range of
$50\,\micron$-$150\,\micron$, clusters of size one to four are
expected due to the charge sharing. Larger clusters are expected due
to other effects such as $\delta$-rays. The most common cluster shapes
are illustrated in \cref{tab:clusizeShapes}.

\begin{table}
  \centering
  \caption{Most common cluster shapes.}
  \label{tab:clusizeShapes}
  \begin{tabular}{ccccc}

    \end{tikzpicture}
    & 4 & 2 & 2 & size 4 ($2\times2$) \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\cref{fig:G4_simu_data_cluSize} compares the cluster-size distribution
in simulations and data for the assemblies operated at nominal
conditions. There is a good agreement between simulation and data in
terms of cluster-size distribution.

    sensors. The assemblies are operated at nominal conditions.}
  \label{fig:G4_simu_data_cluSize}
\end{figure}


The fraction of different cluster sizes depends on the operating
conditions of the assemblies like the bias voltage and the threshold
of the readout ASICs. \cref{fig:cluSize_operatingConditions} shows the
cluster size fraction for a $150\,\micron$ thick sensor (assembly
W5\_F1) operated at different bias voltages and thresholds.  

Higher bias voltages reduce the amount of charge sharing since the
drift time is lowered in a stronger electric field and the charges
diffuse less in the transverse direction. For very low bias voltages,
the sensor is under-depleted. An increase in bias voltage in this
regime increases the charge sharing. The pixel neighbouring a hit
pixel is more likely to be over threshold as more charge is
collected. The results for other assemblies are shown in
\cref{fig:clusterSize_vs_biasVoltage}.

Lowering the threshold leads to an increase in the average cluster
size fraction distribution. Results for all assemblies are shown in
\cref{fig:clusterSize_vs_THLscan}.

    and (b) threshold for the assembly W5\_F1 with a $150\,\micron$

  \label{fig:cluSize_operatingConditions}
\end{figure}


The cluster size fraction as a function of the sensor thickness for
data recorded at the nominal operating conditions is shown in
\cref{fig:cluSize_thickness}. Charge sharing increases with sensor
thickness. The fraction of $1\times2$ and $2\times1$-pixel clusters
are very similar for square pixels and the curve labeled 2-pixel
clusters combine these two cluster geometries. The simulation is in
good agreement with data. This validates the digitiser as described in
\cref{sec:allpix_digitisation}.

    simulation is in good agreement with data.}
  \label{fig:cluSize_thickness}
\end{figure}

%% --------------------------------------------- %%
\subsection{Charge sharing as a function of the track position}

The charge sharing is studied by extrapolating the track position
obtained from the Timepix3 telescope to the DUT. The size of the
clusters depends on the track position within the pixel. For
perpendicular tracks, multi-pixel clusters are created when the track
hits the edges or the corners of a pixel, leading to the charge
sharing between the pixel and its neighbouring pixels. The charge
sharing is also affected by the operating threshold of the readout
ASIC. \cref{fig:chargeSharingTrack} illustrates the track position
within the pixel for 1 to 4-pixel cluster sizes for a $50\,\micron$
sensor. For other thicknesses, the track position within the pixel is
shown in
\cref{fig:chargeSharingTrack_W19_G7,fig:chargeSharingTrack_W5_E2,fig:chargeSharingTrack_W5_F1}. For
thinner sensors, the track position should be closer to the edges of
the pixels to create two-pixel clusters.

\end{figure}

% \cref{fig:chargeSharing_2PC} compares the track position within the

%     histograms are scaled to have a unit area).}

% \end{figure}


\subsection{Single-point resolution}

From the test-beam data, the residuals are calculated by comparing the
reconstructed hit position with the extrapolated track position
obtained by the telescope. This residual combines in quadrature the
single-point (or hit) and the track resolutions:

\begin{equation}
  \sigma_{\mathrm{residual}}^{2}=\sigma_{\mathrm{hit}}^{2}+\sigma_{\mathrm{track}}^{2} .
  \label{eq:residualEq}
\end{equation}

In the following, the tracking resolution of $\sim2\,\micron$ is not
unfolded from the residual measurements presented. 
% For the estimation
% of the single-point resolution, the tracking resolution of
% $\sim2\,\micron$ at the SPS test beam should be unfolded
% (c.f.~\cref{ch:Telescope}).

The residuals depend highly on the cluster sizes since the
reconstructed hit position takes into account the number of the hit
pixels in a cluster and the charge information in each
pixel. \cref{fig:residuals_cluSize} illustrates the residuals for a
$50\,\micron$ thick sensor (assembly W19\_G7) for different cluster
sizes. For single-pixel clusters, the hit position corresponds to the
geometric center of the pixel and therefore the charge information can
not improve the resolution. For multi-pixel clusters, by using the
charge information, a more accurate interpolation of the hit position
can be obtained and the resolution is better than the geometrical
information (by using the $\eta$-correction method as described in
\cref{sec:EtaCorrection}).

    ($2\times2$) and (d) Cluster size 4 ($2\times2$). The track
    resolution of $\sim2\,\micron$ is not unfolded.}
  \label{fig:residuals_cluSize}
\end{figure}

The overall residual is defined by the RMS of the residual of all
tracks combined. The distribution of the residuals for different
sensor thicknesses operated at nominal conditions in simulation and
data is shown in \cref{fig:G4_simu_data_Residuals}. The wider
component in the residual distributions corresponds to the
single-pixel clusters. For thicker sensors, the fraction of
multi-pixel clusters increases. This leads to a higher fraction of
more precisely reconstructed hits and therefore the residual
distribution gets narrower. There is a good agreement between
simulation and data in terms of the residuals distribution.

The factors affecting the fraction of different cluster sizes such as
the sensor thickness and the operating conditions of the assembly
(threshold and bias voltage) affect as well the
residuals. \cref{fig:Residuals_bias_threshold} shows the RMS of the
residuals in the x and y directions for a $50\,\micron$ thick sensor
(assembly W19\_G7) as a function of the bias voltage and the
threshold. The residuals follow the same trend as the cluster size
distributions: higher fractions of single-pixel clusters result in
larger residuals.

% For other assemblies, these plots are shown in
% \cref{fig:Residuals_vs_biasVoltage,fig:Residuals_vs_Threshold}.

For the assemblies operated at the nominal operating conditions, the

results in lower residuals. Again, a good agreement between data and

\subsection{Global detection efficiency}

The detection efficiency of the assemblies is defined as the fraction
of total number of hits matched to tracks (within a window of radius
0.1~mm) and the total number of tracks projected to pass through the
assembly. The efficiency is calculated within the matrix of
$256\times256$ pixels of the main sensor area and the hot or masked
pixels are not excluded from this calculation. They contribute to the
assemblies' inefficiencies.

The detection efficiency is strongly related to the operating
threshold of the readout ASIC. With a lower threshold, smaller energy
depositions can be measured and it is more likely to detect a
particle. \cref{fig:efficiency_VS_Threshold} shows the detection
efficiency for different sensor thicknesses. For thinner sensors, the
energy deposition is lower and the efficiency drops more quickly by
increasing the threshold than for thick sensors.

    the efficiencies between $95\%$ and $100\%$. The calculation of
    the efficiency does not exclude the track hitting the masked
    pixels, therefore the efficiency is slightly lower than $100\%$.}

%% $\sim2\,\micron$ is not unfolded in the residuals distribution. The
%% simulation is in good agreement with the data and is used to predict
%% the performance of smaller pixel pitches.

\section{Extrapolation to smaller pixels}

As seen in this chapter, the Timepix3 readout ASIC is used as a test
vehicle for the characterisation of thin sensors. The test-beam
measurements and the AllPix simulations show a good
agreement. Although, the Timepix3 ASIC has a pixel pitch of
$55\,\micron$ and the goal for the CLIC vertex detector is to achieve
pixels of pitch $25\,\micron$. The CLICpix readout ASIC~\cite{clicpix}
implemented in 65~nm CMOS technology with a pitch of $25\,\micron$ is
under development. But miniaturisation presents limits in the size of
the bump bonding, wire bonding pads as well as cross talks between the
pixels. A single-chip indium bump bonding process for $25\,\micron$
pitch has been developed at SLAC~\cite{SLACBumpBonding} and a few
assemblies with $200\,\micron$ thick planar sensors are successfully
bump-bonded to CLICpix ASICs. The yield stays limited and unconnected,
shorted and dead pixels are present~\cite{AlipourTehrani2016}. At the
moment, these assemblies can not be used to fully characterise the
thin sensors.

Previously, we have seen a good agreement between the AllPix
simulations and the data taken in the test beams for thin silicon
sensors. The simulation can be used to predict the performance of thin
sensors and small pitches in terms of charge sharing without taking
into account the features due to the miniaturisation of the bumps or
the performance of the CLICpix ASIC.

Figure~\ref{fig:cluSize25Pitch} shows the cluster-size distribution
and the hit residuals for an extrapolation of the simulation to
$25\,\micron$ pitch pixels with $50\,\micron$ thick sensors with a
Timepix3-type readout ASIC operated at 500 electrons threshold with
10-bit TOT measurement and an electronic noise of $\sim$90
electrons. The same digitiser as the one used to validate the
simulation is used for the extrapolation. Even with a small pitch, in
such thin sensors, $\sim$70\% of clusters originating from minimum
ionising particles contain one pixel (the fraction of single-pixel
clusters with a $55\,\micron$ pitch is $\sim 83\%$). The residual
distribution is therefore dominated by the broad peak from
single-pixel clusters and the resulting resolution of
$\sim6.4\,\micron$ (the tracking resolution is not unfolded) is still
significantly worse than the required $3\,\micron$. It can be
concluded that the required resolution can not be achieved with the
$25\,\micron$ pitch. Smaller pixels can show other limiting
factors. The CLIC pixel detector R\&D is considering new solution
where planar sensors are not used.

\section{Summary}
\label{sec:Summary_ThinSensors}

In this chapter, we give an overview on the test-beam measurements and
\textsc{Geant4}-based simulation studies for thin sensors using the
Timepix3 ASIC. The simplified model for the diffusion of charges in
silicon as described in \cref{sec:allpix_digitisation} gives a good
agreement with data in terms of energy-deposition spectrum,
cluster-size distribution and residuals distribution. Therefore, the
simulation is used for predicting the resolution of $50\,\micron$ thin
sensors with small pixel sizes of $25\,\micron$. This prediction shows
the limits of charge sharing for thin planar sensors even with small
pixel sizes on top of other constraints due to the miniaturisation of
pixels.
