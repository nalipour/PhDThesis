\chapter{The Timepix3 beam telescope}
\label{ch:Telescope}
% ==============================================================================  

%% --------------------------------------------- %% 

Testing in a high energy beam is a crucial step in the R\&D for the
pixel detector sensors and readout chips. Test beam data are used at
various stages of the development for evaluating the performance of a
prototype in addition to simulations tools like TCAD and
\textsc{Geant4}.

A telescope is used to reconstruct the tracks of the particles going
through its planes. The track position is then extrapolated on the
Device Under Test (DUT). This allows to compare the position of the
hit on the DUT with the reconstructed track and extract the position
and time resolutions as well as the efficiency of the device.

For the CLIC vertex detector R\&D, the CLICdp Timepix3 telescope is
used as a beam reference. This chapter gives an overview of the
components of the Timepix3 telescope and its tracking performance. The
Timepix3 telescope is implemented in AllPix simulations
(c.f. \cref{sec:AllPix}) and its performance is compared to the data
taken at the CERN SPS~\cite{SPS}. Finally, the tracking resolution on
the DUT is extracted in simulations using the Monte Carlo information.

%% --------------------------------------------- %%
\section{Experimental setup at the CERN SPS}
\label{sec:CERN_SPS}
The Timepix3 telescope is placed at the H6 beam~\cite{H6Beamline} of
the CERN SPS typically operated with a $120\,\gev$ pion beam. The
assemblies listed in \cref{tab:Timepix3Assemblies} are tested as DUTs
using this telescope. The beam is configured in such a way to have
$\sim2.6 \times 10^6$ particles per five-second spill. The telescope
planes are positioned in a way to give the best tracking resolution
for the given beam energy taking into account multiple scatterings and
mechanical constraints.

\section{Components of the Timepix3 telescope}

%% --------------------------------------------- %%
\subsection{Coordinates system}
A Cartesian right-handed coordinate system is chosen to describe the
geometry of the telescope. The z-direction is along the beam as shown
in \cref{fig:TPX3Telescope} and the y-direction points vertically in
the up direction.

%% --------------------------------------------- %%
\subsection{Sensors and mechanics}
\label{sec:Telescope_sensors_mechanics}

The Timepix3 telescope consists of six planes of Timepix3
ASICs~\cite{Timepix3Poikela} bump bonded to $300\,\micron$ thick
p-in-n planar sensors as shown in \cref{fig:TPX3Telescope}. The
sensors are depleted at a voltage of 30~V and a bias voltage of 50~V
is applied. The Timepix3 readout chip threshold is set to $\sim1000$
electrons. The planes are rotated by $9\degrees$ around the x axis
(perpendicular to the beam axis) and the z axis (parallel to the beam
axis) \cite{Akiba:2013yxa}. Given the pixel pitch and the sensor
thickness, this angle mainly leads to clusters of three-hit
pixels. Combining the TOT information, the reconstructed hit position
provides sub-pixel resolution. A tracking resolution of
$\sim$$2\,\micron$ on the DUT can be obtained.

  \caption{The Timepix3 beam reference telescope with six planes for
    the tracking and the DUT in the middle inserted perpendicular to
    the beam direction.}
  \label{fig:TPX3Telescope}
\end{figure}

The mechanical support for the telescope planes are optimised in order
to reduce the multiple scatterings of the particles and therefore
improving the tracking resolution. The Timepix3 assemblies are mounted
on a PCB as shown in \cref{fig:Timepix3board_PCB}. An aluminum support
is used to hold the PCB which does not cover the sensor. To protect
the sensors from light exposure, an ABS plastic material is used as
cover with a thickness of 2~mm and placed at a distance of 10~mm away
from the PCB (in black in
\cref{fig:TPX3Telescope}). \cref{tab:TPX3TelescopeMaterial} describes
the material (with their thicknesses and radiation lengths) seen by
the particles for each telescope plane which contributes to the
multiple scatterings. The PCB stacks up eight layers of copper
interlacing with Isola IS410 type material with an average fill factor
of $75\%$ for copper. Behind the PCB, a layer of Copper is used for
the cooling of the chip. The total material of a telescope plane is
estimated to correspond to $\sim4\%$~X\textsubscript{0}.

\subsection{Data taking conditions}
The SPIDR readout system, as described in \cref{sec:TimepixReadout},
is used for the data acquisition of the Timepix3 telescope planes. The
Timepix3 readout ASICs are operated with the data-driven
zero-suppressed readout mode. This system allows to record the data
from all the particles from the SPS spill without dead time. The data
is processed offline using the EUTelescope framework as described in
\cref{sec:recoSoft}.


%% --------------------------------------------- %%
\section{Timepix3 telescope performance}
\label{sec:telescopePerformance}

The Timepix3 telescope is simulated with the \textsc{Geant4}-based
AllPix simulation framework (c.f. \cref{sec:AllPix}). This allows for
a better understanding of the telescope performance, extraction of the
tracking resolution on the DUT and comparison to data. Since AllPix
gives access to the Monte Carlo Truth position (MC position) of the
hits, the true tracking resolution can be obtained by comparing the MC
position with the reconstructed track or hit positions.

\subsection{Timepix3 telescope simulation in AllPix}
In the simulations, the geometry of the telescope is defined as
realistic as possible by taking into account the positions and the
rotations of the telescope planes, the thickness of the sensors and
the pixel pitch. \cref{fig:Timepix3Telescope_Allpix} shows the
geometry of the telescope as implemented in AllPix.

The mechanical support for the telescope planes is implemented using
the material as described in \cref{tab:TPX3TelescopeMaterial}.

% \textsc{Geant4} provides the class \textsc{G4Material} which describes
% the macroscopic properties of the material used in simulations and
% contains all the relevant information on its constituent elements. The
% density and the radiation length of the material are the two main
% properties to be considered for the simulations. \textsc{Geant4}
% already provides a material database for all the standard material
% such as copper and silicon. For the Isola IS410, the material
% G4\_BONE\_COMPACT\_ICRU has the closest radiation length and
% density. For the sensor covers in ABS plastic, their constituent
% elements
% (C\textsubscript{8}H\textsubscript{8}~C\textsubscript{4}H\textsubscript{6}~C\textsubscript{3}H\textsubscript{3}N)
% have been implemented as a \textsc{G4Material} in the simulations to
% obtain the correct density and radiation length.

    shown in this figure.}
  \label{fig:Timepix3Telescope_Allpix}
\end{figure}


A digitiser for the Timepix3 readout chips bump-bonded to planar
sensors is defined in AllPix. It simulates the silicon physics by
calculating the diffusion at each \textsc{Geant4} step as described in
\cref{sec:allpix_digitisation}. The contribution of the generated
charge by diffusion in the hit pixel and all its direct neighbouring
pixels is calculated for each step. All the contributions add-up and
the charge in each pixel is calculated. The electronic noise of the
Timepix3 ASIC sums up to the charge in each pixel. Finally a threshold
is applied to each pixel and finally, the pixel-by-pixel TOT
calibration (c.f.~\cref{sec:EnergyCalibration}) is applied.

\textsc{Geant4} General Particle Source (GPS) is used for the
simulation of $120\,\gev$ pions. The GPS generates a parallel beam
with a transverse (radial) standard deviation of 5~mm.

The spread of the tracks used in simulations due to the multiple
scatterings is shown in \cref{fig:MCbeamAngleDistr}. A scattering of
0.1~mrad can cause a displacement of up to $\sim3\,\micron$. The
angles $\phi$ and $\theta$ are given as:

\begin{equation}
  \phi=arctan{{x_2-x_{DUT}} \over {z_2-z_{DUT}}} \; ,
  \label{eq:beamAnglePhi}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  \theta=arctan{{y_2-y_{DUT}} \over {z_2-z_{DUT}}} \; ,
  \label{eq:beamAngleTheta}
\end{equation}

where $x, y$ and $z$ are the MC positions of the hits on the planes 2
and the DUT.

    planes.}
  \label{fig:MCbeamAngleDistr}
\end{figure}

The EUTelescope software framework (c.f. \cref{sec:EUTelescope}) is
used to reconstruct the hits on the telescope planes using the
$\eta$-correction method~\cite{Belau:1983eh}. The tracks are fitted
based on a $\chi^2$-minimisation method as described in
\cref{sec:EUTelescope}.

%% --------------------------------------------- %%
\subsection{Single-hit resolution on the telescope planes}

The parameters as described in \cref{sec:Telescope_sensors_mechanics}
are used for the AllPix simulations of the sensors of the telescope
planes. The bias and the depletion voltages, the sensor type and the
threshold values are the parameters defining the charge sharing and
the cluster size distribution. Therefore they define the intrinsic
resolution of the sensors.

% \begin{table}[htbp]
%   \centering
%   \caption{Parameters used for the simulation of the telescope planes in AllPix.}
%   \label{tab:AllPixTelescopePlanesParams}
%   \begin{tabular}{cccc}
%     \toprule
%     Bias voltage [V] & Depletion voltage [V] & Sensor type & Threshold [e-] \\
%     \midrule
%     50 & 30 & p-in-n & 1000 \\
%     \bottomrule
%   \end{tabular}
% \end{table}


\cref{fig:TelescopeCluSize_data_simu} compares the cluster size
distribution and the charge of the clusters in data and simulations
for the first telescope plane (plane 0). There is a good agreement
between the cluster-size distributions in data and simulations. In
data, there is less single-pixel clusters due to slight imperfections
in the rotations of the planes while placing the telescope whereas the
simulation assumes a perfect placement of the telescope planes.

  \label{fig:TelescopeCluSize_data_simu}
\end{figure}

The hit resolution of a telescope plane is given by comparing the
reconstructed hit position with the Monte Carlo Truth position
(x\textsubscript{MC} and y\textsubscript{MC}) obtained by AllPix
simulations. \cref{fig:TelPlane0_MC_hit} shows the hit residuals of
the first telescope plane in x and y directions in simulations which
depend on their thickness, charge sharing and rotations. The hit
resolution is also considered as the intrinsic resolution of the
sensors. The standard deviation of a Gaussian fit on the center
$95.5\%$ of the residuals distribution gives a resolution of
$\sim2.7\,\micron$. Since the residual distribution has a large tail,
the RMS of the distribution higher and is $\sim5.4\,\micron$. The tail
in the residuals distribution is due to the reconstruction of the hit
positions of single-pixel clusters where the resolution is defined by
the pixel pitch and the charge sharing can not be used to improved the
reconstructed position.

% For this calculation, hits corresponding to tracks with the $10\%$ of
% highest $\chi^2$/NDF are ignored.

    directions given by comparing the MC and the reconstructed hit
    positions.}
  \label{fig:TelPlane0_MC_hit}
\end{figure}

The residuals as a function of the x\textsubscript{MC} and
y\textsubscript{MC} are shown in \cref{fig:TelPlane0_MC_hit_2D}. The
intrinsic resolution does not depend on the position of the hit. This
confirms the coherence between the geometry description in the AllPix
simulations and the EUTelescope reconstruction. The shape of these
distributions is due to the beam profile which is more focused in the
middle of the sensors.

%% --------------------------------------------- %%
\subsection{Biased residuals on each telescope plane}

The tracks on the telescope planes are reconstructed using a
$\chi^2$-minimisation method as described in
\cref{sec:EUTelescope}. The tracks are reconstructed in a biased way
since they include the hit information on each telescope plane. The
biased residual on each telescope plane is defined as the difference
between the measured hit and the biased fitted track position. It
determines the precision with which the track is reconstructed and
depends on the hit resolution of the telescope sensors, the number of
measurements and their positions and finally on the amount of multiple
scattering. 

The biased residual width $r_b^2(z)$, for tracks at all positions
$z=z_i$, is the distance between the reconstructed hit and the biased
track fit and defined as~\cite{Jansen:2016bkd}:

\begin{equation}
r_b^2(z)=\sigma_{int}^2(z)-\sigma_{t,b}^2(z) \; , 
\end{equation}

where $\sigma_{int}$ is the intrinsic (or hit) resolution of sensors
and $\sigma_{t,b}$ is the biased track resolution. $\sigma_{t,b}$
determines the precision with which the particle trajectory is defined
with a biased track. For the inner planes of the telescope, since more
measurement points are available, $\sigma_{t,b}$ decreases which leads
to higher values for the biased residuals. Whereas, for outer planes
where less measurement points are available (planes 0 and 6),
$\sigma_{t,b}$ gets worse (increases) and gets closer to the intrinsic
resolution of the sensors.

The biased residuals depend highly on the quality of the tracks. The
tracks with high $\chi^2$/NDF go through more multiple scatterings and
therefore contribute to the tails of the biased residuals. For the
in-pixel analysis done in \cref{ch:ThinSensorsStudies}, the tracks
with a $\chi^2$/NDF higher than 100 are discarded.

\cref{fig:chi2_data_simu} shows the $\chi^2$/NDF distributions in data
(a) and in simulations (b) with the cut at 100 on the $\chi^2$/NDF as
illustrated with a red line.

\end{figure}

\cref{fig:telescopeBiasedRMS_data_simu} compares the RMS of the biased
residuals in data and simulations (the original distributions are
given in
\cref{fig:telescope_biasedResiduals_data_X,fig:telescope_biasedResiduals_data_Y}
for data and
\cref{fig:telescope_biasedResiduals_simu_X,fig:telescope_biasedResiduals_simu_Y}
for simulation). For this calculation, a cut is applied the tracks
with $\chi^2$/NDF higher than 100 are discarded.

\begin{figure}[htbp] \centering
  \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.45\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/Telescope/biasedResiduals/RMSX_simu_vs_data.pdf}
    \caption{}

    planes. A cut is applied to discard the tracks with $\chi^2$/NDF

  \label{fig:telescopeBiasedRMS_data_simu}
\end{figure}

As expected, the inner planes show a higher biased resolution than the
outer ones. The simulation is in good agreement with data in terms of
biased residuals. This means that the hit resolution of the telescope
planes and the amount of the multiple scatterings in the simulation
are close to reality and the simulation can be used to get a good
estimation of the tracking resolution on the DUT.




\subsection{Tracking resolution on the DUT}
The tracking residuals on the DUT in the x and y directions is shown
in \cref{fig:DUT_MC_track}. This value can be only obtained in
simulations as the MC position is needed. For this calculation, the
same cut on the $\chi^2$/NDF as shown in \cref{fig:chi2_data_simu} is
applied for the track selection.

\begin{figure}[htbp] \centering
  \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.45\textwidth}

    \textsc{Geant4} in AllPix simulations in (a) x and (b) y
    directions.}
  \label{fig:DUT_MC_track}
\end{figure}


The tracking resolution on the DUT as a function of the
x\textsubscript{MC} and y\textsubscript{MC} positions is shown in
\cref{fig:DUT_MC_track_2D}. The standard deviation of the
distributions is less than $2\,\micron$ when fitted by a Gaussian on
the $95.5\%$ of the residual distribution. The RMS of the residuals is
slightly higher than $2\,\micron$ and this is due to the tails of the
distribution. A more strict cut on the $\chi^2$/NDF discards tracks in
the tails and reduces the RMS of the distribution.

In the y-direction, the residuals show a shift of
$\sim1\,\micron$. This can be explained to the fact that in the
y-direction, the three planes before the DUT are rotated in an
asymmetric way compared to the three other planes after the DUT in the
Timepix3 telescope and can be corrected while aligning the DUT.

\section{Summary}
\label{sec:Summary_Telescope}

The simulations confirm that the Timepix3 telescope allows for a high
resolution track reconstruction on the DUT ($\sim2\,\micron$) as
expected by~\cite{Akiba:2013yxa}. This telescope is adapted for
in-pixel studies and testing the DUTs with high resolution constraints
as expected for CLIC. In \cref{ch:ThinSensorsStudies} the Timepix3
telescope is used to precisely measure the resolution of thin sensors.
