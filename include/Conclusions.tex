The vertex detector plays a key role to fully exploit the physics
potential at CLIC. To meet the challenging demands on the precision
physics, pixel detectors with high spatial resolution and low material
content are required.

In this thesis, an overview on the R\&D of planar pixel sensors for
CLIC is given. Prototypes with thin and active-edge sensors are
studied. We span a large set of activities for the characterisation of
these assemblies in test-beam and laboratory measurements. All studies
are accompanied by simulations.

The physics goals set challenging requirements on the design of the
CLIC detector. The vertex detector is responsible for the efficient
tagging of heavy quarks through the precise measurement of the
displaced vertices. For achieving high efficiencies, a low material
content of $\sim0.2\%$~X\textsubscript{0} per vertex layer and a high
single-point resolution of $3\,\micron$ for pixels are required. The
flavour-tagging performance of the CLIC vertex detector in full
detector simulations have shown that the material budget of the
detector must be as low as possible to achieve higher flavour-tagging
efficiencies. To attain both requirements on the material content and
the resolution, hybrid solutions with $50\,\micron$ thick sensors are
foreseen to be coupled to $50\,\micron$ thick readout ASICs with
$25\,\micron$ pixel pitch.

We have focused on the performance of thin planar silicon sensors for
the CLIC vertex detector. The Timepix3 pixel readout ASIC is chosen as
a test-vehicle for thin sensors. With its low front-end noise of
$\sim80$ electrons, it allows for operating the chip at the low
thresholds of $\sim500$ electrons. This ASIC provides internal
test-pulse injections for the calibration of the threshold DAC value
and the TOT into energy depositions and validated with simulations.

The CLICdp Timepix3 telescope is used for the reconstruction of the
tracks with a high resolution and in-pixel studies on the devices
under test (DUT). The telescope is implemented in AllPix
simulations. The tracking resolution of the telescope on the DUT of
$\sim2\,\micron$ is extracted from the simulation. This is in
agreement with the expectations.

First, we have investigated on the spatial resolutions achieved with
thin sensors. Assemblies with $50\,\micron$ to $150\,\micron$ thick
sensors bump-bonded to Timepix3 readout ASICs are measured during
test-beam campaigns at the CERN SPS.

  

\cref{sec:SiliconTheory} gives an introduction to semiconductor
material with an accent on silicon which is predominant in tracking
detectors in particle physics experiments. Theoretical concepts are
introduced and later used for the simulation and understanding of the
test-beam data. Different methods modeling the energy deposition
spectrum of high-energy particles in silicon are presented. The
Bichsel model gives the most accurate energy spectrum for thin
sensors. The charge transport in a pn-junction is studied. Drift and
diffusion are calculated in a pn-junction and used in the next
chapters for simulations. The position measurement and ways to improve
the spatial resolution are investigated and the crucial role of charge
sharing in improving the pointing resolution of pixel detectors is
shown.

The Timepix3 pixel readout ASIC is used as the tracking planes for the
Timepix3 telescope as well as for the study of thin and active-edge
sensors. \cref{ch:FE_electronics} introduces this pixel readout
ASIC. The test-pulse calibration method is chosen to convert the
threshold DAC and the TOT into energy. The calibration is applied to
the test-beam data and the energy spectrum in data agrees well with
simulations. The calibration is therefore validated.

The reconstruction software frameworks used for the analysis of data
and simulations are described in \cref{ch:Software}. The AllPix
reconstruction framework and TCAD simulation tools are also
introduced. Both simulation frameworks are powerfull tools for
understanding the data. AllPix is a \textsc{Geant4}-based simulation
frameworks which allows for reproducing the energy-deposition spectrum
and the charge sharing in thin silicon sensors. The test-beam setup is
also implemented in this framework and the beam telescope is
simulated. The finite-element TCAD simulations allow for modeling the
processing of a silicon detector and the device operation. It is
mainly used to investigate the performance of the active-edge
technology in thin silicon sensors.

The CLICdp Timepix3 telescope is presented in \cref{ch:Telescope}. It
allows for the reconstruction of the tracks with a high resolution and
in-pixel studies on the devices under test (DUT). The telescope is
implemented in AllPix simulations. The tracking resolution of the
telescope on the DUT of $\sim2\,\micron$ is extracted from the
simulation. This is in agreement with the expectations.

Test-beam measurements and Allpix simulations for $50-150\,\micron$
thin planar sensors are described in \cref{ch:ThinSensorsStudies}. The
pointing resolution of the assemblies are studied and the simulations
are in good agreement with data. For the CLIC vertex detector, a hit
resolution of $\sim3\,\micron$ is wished to be achieved with pixels of
$25\,\micron$ pitch and a thickness of $50\,\micron$. Since data is
still not available for such pixel detectors, the simulations are
extrapolated for such small pixels. The simulations show that
achieving this resolution with $25\,\micron$ pixels is not possible.

\cref{ch:ActiveEdgeSensors} investigates the efficiency of active-edge
sensors. Different edge widths and guard-ring configurations are
investigated. A TCAD simulation of the edge is as well implemented
which allows for better understanding of the operation of such
devices. In simulations, as expected, the floating guard-ring seems to
be the best solution as it shows a higher breakdown voltage and a
small loss of energy deposition in the guard ring and therefore a high
efficiency up to the trench of the sensor. The grounded guard ring is
however not recommended for thin sensors of $50\,\micron$ since the
guard ring collects most of the charge deposition at the edge and the
edge is inefficient in this case. Test-beam data are in general in
good agreement with simulations. However few discrepancies in terms of
breakdown behaviour and the charge collected at the edge between
simulations and data are observed. During the test-beam, we only had
one assembly per configuration at our disposal. More assemblies are
needed to be tested in order to draw final conclusions, especially, to
confirm that the floating guard ring is the most suitable solution for
$50\,\micron$ thick sensors.

\section{Outlook}

Miniaturisation of pixels to $25\,\micron$ pitch is necessary to
achieve a high spatial resolution of $3\,\micron$ as required by the
CLIC vertex detector. But thin planar sensors of $50\,\micron$, do not
provide enough information through charge sharing in order to reach
the required resolution. Also, bump-bonding of sensors to readout
ASICs becomes more complicated for such small pixel sizes. Other
sensors technologies, such as the High-Voltage (HV) CMOS
process~\cite{Tehrani:2016ogb}, are under investigation for CLIC,
which can be glued to the readout ASICs (instead of bump-bonding), and
provide some information through charge sharing.

Up to now, the full detector simulations for CLIC were done with a
$3\,\micron$ hit resolution for the vertex detector. The extrapolation
done in this thesis for $25\,\micron$ pitch and $50\,\micron$ thick
planar sensors can be taken as input for the digitisers in full
simulations. The effect of a worse resolution on flavour-tagging can
be studied and this might change the requirements on the spatial
resolutions of the CLIC vertex detector.

The two-dimensional TCAD simulation of active-edge sensors gives
promising results and fulfills the expectations. The floating guard
ring appears to be the most suitable solution, as it shows a high
detection efficiency at the edge and an acceptable breakdown
behaviour. In the future, a three-dimensional simulation can provide
more precision on the capacitive coupling between the guard ring and
the pixels. In data, new assemblies are needed to be tested in order
to confirm the best option of guard ring for thin sensors.

% \begin{itemize}
% \item Thin planar sensors reaching their limits: other solutions such
%   as HV-CMOS can be also attractive.
% \item Design of readout ASIC important in terms of noise. Operating at
%   lower threshold can help.
% \item Miniaturisation and the limits
% \item Input for realistic digitiser for the CLIC full simulation. 
% \item Active-edge assemblies: floating guard ring is the best solution
%   (breakdown and detection efficiency) for thin sensors. We see an
%   early breakdown and a large fraction of the deposited charge in the
%   guard ring. A readout more adapted for this option is needed to
%   fully confirm the expectations. Ladders of detectors should be built
%   to fully confirm the assumptions.
