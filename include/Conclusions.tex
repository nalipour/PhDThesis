This thesis, gives an overview on the CLIC experiment. The accelerator
is briefly described and the physics potential of the experiment is
given. The requirements on the CLIC detector are presented with a
focus of the vertex detector which is the main subject of the work
presented.

An overview of the R\&D on the planar pixelated silicon detectors is
detailed with laboratory and test-beam
measurements. \textsc{Geant4}-based and TCAD simulations are performed
and validated with a comparison to the collected data. In this thesis,
we span a large set of activities starting from calibration of
assemblies, to resolution studies of the telescope used to finally
characterise thin sensors and different options of active-edge
technology and their impact on the particle detection. A summary of
these activities is given here below.

\cref{sec:SiliconTheory} gives an introduction to semiconductor
material with an accent on silicon which is predominant in tracking
detectors in particle physics experiments. Theoretical concepts are
introduced and used later in the thesis for the simulation and
understanding of the test-beam data. Different methods modeling the
energy deposition spectrum of high-energy particles are given. The
Bichsel model is the solution which gives the most accurate energy
spectrum especially for thin sensors. The charge transport in a
pn-junction is studied. Drift and diffusion in a pixel detector are
introduced with a simplified model. The position measurement and ways
to improve the spatial resolution are investigated.

The Timepix3 pixel readout ASIC is introduced. In

\section{Outlook}
\begin{itemize}
\item Thin planar sensors reaching their limits: other solutions such
  as HV-CMOS can be also attractive.
\item Design of readout ASIC important in terms of noise. Operating at
  lower threshold can help.
\item Miniaturisation and the limits
\item Input for realistic digitiser for the CLIC full simulation. 
\item Active-edge assemblies: floating guard ring is the best solution
  (breakdown and detection efficiency) for thin sensors. We see an
  early breakdown and a large fraction of the deposited charge in the
  guard ring. A readout more adapted for this option is needed to
  fully confirm the expectations. Ladders of detectors should be built
  to fully confirm the assumptions.
\end{itemize}
