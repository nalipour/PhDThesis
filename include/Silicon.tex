\chapter{Semiconductor detectors for radiation detection}
\label{sec:SiliconTheory}
%==============================================================================    
Semiconductor materials have a great advantage in many radiation
detection applications. The main benefits are the high energy
resolution due to the large number of carriers that are created by a
given incident radiation, their compact sizes, fast timing and the
effective thickness can be adapted to the requirements of the
applications. Though, they show some limitations for smaller sizes and
their performance can degrade from ration induced damages. Silicon
detectors are predominant for charge particle spectroscopy among
semiconductor materials. 

In this chapter, we will review the basic properties of semiconductor
material, charge generation in silicon and the transport of charge
carriers through drift and diffusion. Pixel detectors are studied
through pn-junctions.

\section{Band structure in solids}
Due to the periodic lattice of crystalline structure of semiconductor
material, electrons within the solid have allowed energy bands. The
energy of the electrons is confined to one of the energy bands and the
bands may be separated by gaps of forbidden
energies.\\ \cref{fig:energyBands} schematically illustrates the bands
in insulators, semiconductors and metals. In the \textit{valence
  band}, the electrons are bonded to specific lattice sites within the
crystal. The electrons in the \textit{conduction band} are free to
move through the crystal and contribute to the electrical
conductivity. The \textit{bandgap} (E\textsubscript{g}) separates the
valence from the conduction band and allows to classify wether the
material is a semiconductor, an insulator or a metal. In the absence
of thermal excitation, the valence band for the semiconductors and
insulators is completely full and the conduction band empty and
therefore they are not electrically conductive. Metals are highly
electrically conductive since the fermi energy level
(E\textsubscript{F}) lies in the conduction band and the electrons are
free to migrate through the material even at very low
temperatures. However, for insulators and semiconductors the electrons
must cross the bandgap to become conductive. The bandgap for
semiconductors ($\sim1\,\ev$) is much lower than for insulators
($\sim5\,\ev$). If an electron in the valence band gains enough
thermal energy to cross the bandgap and reach the conduction band, it
leaves behind a vacancy (a hole) behind in the valence band. The
electron-hole pair can move under the influence of an external
electric field (electrons in the opposite direction of the
holes). This motion creates conductivity in the material. This
property is exploited in silicon detectors to detect radiation and is
developed more in the coming sections.

\section{Charge generation and recombination in silicon}\label{sec:chargeInSi}

\subsection{Bethe-Bloch formula}
In silicon, free charge careers are generated due to thermal effects
and lead to leakage current. A current is also generated due to the
interaction of charged particles with silicon and can be
detected. Part of the absorbed energy generates electron-hole pairs
through scattering processes with the shell electrons of silicon and
can be collected by the readout electronics. The number of
electron-hole pairs produced in the detector as well as the total
energy loss of the particle in the detector are stochastic quantities.

The energy loss along the particle track is described by the
Bethe-Bloch formula~\cite{Beringer:1900zz}.

\begin{equation}
  - \braket{{dE}\over{dx}} = 4 \pi N_A r_{e}^2 m_e c^2 z^2 \frac{Z}{A}  \frac{1}{\beta^2} \left[ \frac{1}{2} \ln{\frac{2 m_e c^2 \beta^2 \gamma^2 T_{max}}{I^2}} - \beta^2 - \frac{\delta\left(\beta\gamma\right)}{2}\right]\; ,
  \label{eq:BetheBloch}
\end{equation}

where $N_A$ is the Avogadro's number, $r_e$ the classical electron
radius, $m_ec^2$ the rest energy of the electron, $z$ is the charge of
the traversing particle, $Z$ the atomic number, $A$ the atomic mass of
the absorption medium, $\beta={v \over c}$,
$\gamma=1/\sqrt{1-\beta^2}$, $I$ the mean excitation energy, $T_{max}$
the maximum kinetic energy that a particle can transfer to a shell
electron and $\delta\left(\beta\gamma\right)$ the density effect
correction to ionisation energy loss. A minimum ionising particle
(MIP) has an energy loss near the minimum of the Bethe-Bloch
formula. Relativistic particles are considered as MIPs.

\subsection{Energy-loss spectrum in silicon}
Ionisation is also subject to statistical fluctuations and
\cref{eq:BetheBloch} gives its average value. It can be described by a
probability density function called \textit{straggling functions} and
characterised by the most probable energy loss ($\Delta_{p}$) and
full-width-at-half-maximum ($w$). \cref{fig:LandauDistribution} shows
examples of this distribution in thin sensors. If a particle is not
stopped in the sensors, the energy deposition varies around the peak
of the distribution with a large tail for high signals. The main
reason for the highly-skewed energy loss distribution is the
manifestation of $\delta$-rays which happens when electrons acquire
enough energy by interaction and themselves become ionising
particles. The $\delta$-rays not only make the average value of the
energy loss higher than the most probable value ($\Delta_{p}$) of the
distribution, but also create big clusters and thus degrade the
spatial resolution of the detector. This is the reason why the Bethe
equation, \cref{eq:BetheBloch}, is ill-defined experimentally and not
used for applications where the energy loss for single particles is
described.

The fluctuations around the $\Delta_{p}$ increase for thinner sensors
and should be taken into account for the design of the dynamic range
of the readout electronics.


\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth, page=14, trim = 50mm 160mm
    40mm 20mm, clip]{Articles/rpp2009-rev-passage-particles-matter.pdf}
  \caption{Straggling functions in silicon for 500 MeV pions,
    normalized to unity at the most probable value. $w$
    is the full-width-at-half-maximum~\cite{Beringer:1900zz}.}
  \label{fig:LandauDistribution}
\end{figure}

In literature, several approaches address the calculation of the
straggling functions. The Landau and the Bichsel models, two of the
most relevant models, are described in \cref{sec:landau,sec:bichsel}. 

The probability of the occurrence of collisions and the probability
for a particular energy loss $E$ are considered for the calculation of
the straggling functions. To obtain correct straggling functions, the
accurate determination of the collision cross section as function of
energy loss, $\sigma(E)$, is necessary.

\subsubsection{The Landau distribution}\label{sec:landau}
The most commonly used model in experiments, is a Landau distribution
convoluted with a Gaussian. The most probable value $\Delta_p$ of the
distribution is given by the Landau-Vavilov
method~\cite{Landau:1944if,Vavilov:1957zz}:

\begin{equation}
  \Delta_p=\xi \left[\text{ln}{{2mc^2\beta^2\gamma^2}\over{I}}+\text{ln}{\xi \over I}+0.200-\beta^2-\delta\left(\beta\gamma\right) \right] \; ,
  \label{eq:LandauVavilovMPV}
\end{equation}

where $\xi=(K/2)\braket{Z/A}(x/\beta^2)$~\mev for a detector of
moderate thickness $x$ in g~\inversecmsquared. All other parameters
are as the ones described for \cref{eq:BetheBloch}.

Though the Landau-Vavilov calculation does not describe correctly the
width of the energy distribution for thin silicon sensors. For thick
material, the width of the distribution is $4\xi$.

For $\gamma>>100$, \cref{eq:LandauVavilovMPV} is simplified to~\cite{Bichsel}

\begin{equation}
  \textsubscript{L}\Delta_{p} (\kev)=t \left(0.1791+0.01782 \ln\left(t\right)\right)
  \label{eq:LandauVavilovMPV_simplified}
\end{equation}

where t (\micron) is the thickness of the silicon.

When the Landau distribution is combined with a Gaussian one, $\Delta_
p$ increases and gives better agreement with data.

\subsubsection{Bichsel model}\label{sec:bichsel}
Bichsel~\cite{Bichsel} takes into account the binding of atomic
electrons to find a better agreement between data and theory. In this
model, experimental and theoretical data for dielectric functions,
x-ray absorption coefficients and generalised oscillator strengths are
used to reproduce accurately the observed energy loss spectrum over a
wide range of incident particle velocities and silicon thicknesses,
including very thin silicon sensors. But no analytical description of
the straggling function is provided. 

Bichsel provides an approximation of $\Delta_{p}$ (\ev) and $w$ (\ev)
as function of the thickness $t$ ($\micron$) of silicon detectors for
particles with charge $\pm1e$ and $\beta\gamma>500$ as listed in
\cref{eq:MPV1,eq:MPV2,eq:FWHM}:

\begin{itemize}
\item For $13<t<110$ [\micron]:
  \begin{equation}
    \Delta_{p}=t \cdot \left(100.6+35.35 \cdot \ln(t) \right)\; ,
    \label{eq:MPV1}
  \end{equation}
\item For $110<t<3000$ [\micron]:
  \begin{equation}
    \Delta_{p}=t \cdot \left(190+16.3 \cdot \ln(t) \right)\; ,
    \label{eq:MPV2}
  \end{equation}
\item For $30<t<260$ [\micron]:
  \begin{equation}
    w=t \cdot \left(259.6-28.41 \cdot \ln(t) \right).
    \label{eq:FWHM}
  \end{equation}
\item For $260<t<2560$ [\micron]:
  \begin{equation}
    w=71.3 t \left( 1+ 39.4/t^{0.8} \right)
    \label{eq:FWHM2}
  \end{equation}
\end{itemize}

\cref{tab:EdepForDifferentThickness} summarises the $\Delta_{p}$
and $w$ for detectors thicknesses at our disposal and tested during
test beams.

\begin{table}[htbp]
  \centering
  \caption{$\Delta_{p}$ and $w$ calculated for silicon sensors with
    different thicknesses using \cref{eq:MPV1,eq:MPV2,eq:FWHM,eq:FWHM2}.}
  \label{tab:EdepForDifferentThickness}
  \begin{tabular}{c c c c}
    \toprule
    Thickness [\micron] &  $\Delta_{p}$ [\kev] & $w$ [\kev] & $\Delta_{p} / w$ \\ 
    \midrule
    50 & 11.9 & 7.42 & 1.6      \\
    100 & 26.34 & 12.88 & 2.045 \\
    150 & 40.75 & 17.59 & 2.32  \\
    200 & 55.27 & 21.82 & 2.53  \\
    300 & 84.89 & 30.18 & 2.8 \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Multiple scattering}

In addition to energy loss, when a particle goes through the detector,
its trajectory is deflected by small-angle scatters. The deflection is
mainly due to the Coulomb interaction of the charged particle with the
nuclei. The strong interaction has also a contribution for
hadrons. When leaving the detector, the scattering angle of the
particle follows a Gaussian distribution with an RMS of~\cite{Lynch:1990sq}

\begin{equation}
  \theta\textsuperscript{RMS}={{13.6\,\mev}\over{\beta p c}} z
\sqrt{x \over X_0} \left[1+0.038\ln{\left(x \over X_0 \right)}\right],
  \label{eq:multipleScattering}
\end{equation}

where the angle $\theta$ is in radians, the particle momentum $p$ in
\mev, $z$ the charge number of the particle and $x/X_0$ the thickness of
the absorption medium in units of the radiation length.

In high-energy physics applications, the material budget of pixel
detectors is minimised in order to have the least scattering angles possible.

\subsection{\textsc{Geant4}}

\textsc{Geant4}~\cite{Agostinelli:2002hh}, as an object-oriented
simulation toolkit implemented in C++ programming language, is widely
used in high energy, nuclear and accelerator physics, medical and
space sciences. As the modern particle physics is going towards
large-scale detectors, more accurate simulations are needed in order
to understand the complex situations. \textsc{Geant4} provides
software components which can be used to study basic phenomena,
geometries and full-scale detector simulations for
experiments. \textsc{Geant4} simulations take into account the
geometry of the system, the materials involved, the fundamental
particles, the generation of primary particles, the tracking of
particles through materials and external electromagnetic fields, the
physics processes involved in the possible interaction of the
particles with the materials they are passing through, the response of
sensitive components and mostly validated with data.

\textsc{Geant4} provides physics models for different type of
interactions called \textit{physics lists}. The \textit{emstandard}
physics lists provide the electromagnetic interactions of photons and
charged particles with matter and is suited for the simulation of
ionisation, bremsstrahlung, gamma conversion and other electromagnetic
interactions of particles with energies from $1\,\kev$ up to
$10\,\pev$~\cite{Apostolakis2009859}. This physics list is commonly
used for the simulation of the energy loss in pixel detectors.

\textsc{Geant4} provides as well the Photo-Absorption Ionisation (PAI)
model~\cite{Apostolakis:2000yu} for the precise simulation of
ionisation energy loss by relativistic charged particles in very thin
absorbers. Since in very thin sensors the Landau model is not
suitable, the PAI model is based on the photo-absorption cross-section
tables obtained by experimental data. In practice several classes are
used to calculate the integral ionisation cross-section, the mean
number of ionising collisions as well as the mean ionisation energy
loss for the selected material and the given Lorentz factor.

\cref{fig:BichselVSG4} compares the energy loss due to ionisation in
$50\,\micron$ and $450\,\micron$ thick silicon sensors for different
\textsc{Geant4} physics lists and the Bichsel model. \textsc{Geant4}
version 10.1.2 is used to obtain these distributions. Version 9.6.2
also showed the same results. For $50\,\micron$ thick sensor, the
\textit{emstandard\_opt3} physics list gives a reasonable value for
the $\Delta_p$ but the width $w$ of the distribution is more narrow
than the Bichsel distribution. The PAI model corrects for $w$ and the
energy deposition is very similar to the Bichsel model. For the thick
sensor of $450\,\micron$, all the \textsc{Geant4} physics lists and
the Bichsel model show similar distributions.

The energy deposition given by the PAI model is very close to the one
calculated by Bichsel especially for the fluctuations around the most
probable value and for very thin sensors. For this reason, the PAI
model is chosen to be used later for the simulations even though it
requires more computation power.

\section{Transport of charge carriers in silicon}

In silicon detectors, the movement of the charge carriers (holes and
electrons) lead to signal pulses in the electrical contacts which can
be detected by the readout electronics. 
In absence of any external electric field, free charge carriers move
randomly and are scattered due to their collisions with the crystal
lattice or other impurities. On average, in equilibrium conditions,
the traveled distance averaged over charges is zero. In addition to
the statistical movement, two other mechanisms can affect the
transport of charge carriers: diffusion (due to a gradient in
concentration) and drift (in the presence of an external electric
field).

The diffusion implies that a carrier is more probable to move from a
high-concentration region to a low-concentration region. The diffusion
current per unit area is given by \cref{eq:diffusionCurrent}~\cite{Rossi:976471}:

\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    J_{n, diff}=-{kT \over e} \mu_n \nabla n \qquad \textnormal{for electrons}
    \; , \\
    J_{p, diff}={kT \over e} \mu_p \nabla p \qquad \textnormal{for holes}
    \; , 
  \end{aligned}
  \label{eq:diffusionCurrent}
\end{equation}
where $k$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ the absolute temperature, $e$ the
elementary charge, $\mu$ the mobility of the charge carriers, $\nabla
n$ and $\nabla p$ are the gradients of the electron and hole
concentrations.

Charge carriers are accelerated between two random collisions in the
presence of an external electric field in the direction of the field
and leads to and average drift velocity given by
\cref{eq:driftVelocity}~\cite{Rossi:976471}:

\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    v_{n}=-\mu_n \textbf{E} \qquad \textnormal{for electrons}
    \; , \\
    v_{p}=\mu_p \textbf{E} \qquad \textnormal{for holes}
    \; , 
  \end{aligned}
  \label{eq:driftVelocity}
\end{equation}
where $v$ is the average drift velocity, $\textbf{E}$ the electric
field and $\mu$ the mobility of the charge carriers. The mobility is a
function of the electric field. For higher electric fields the charge
carriers gain more acceleration and the number of collisions per unit
time becomes highe. This leads to a saturation of the drift velocity
$v_s$. The mobility dependence on the electric field is described by
\cref{eq:mobility} and parameters described in
\cref{tab:mobility_parameters}~\cite{Jacoboni197777}:
\begin{equation}
  \mu=\frac{v_{s}/E_{c}}{\left[1+(E/E_{c})^{\beta}\right]^{1/\beta}}\; .
  \label{eq:mobility}
\end{equation}

\begin{table}[htbp]
  \centering
  \caption{Parameters for the mobility as described in
    \cref{eq:mobility} with T the absolute temperature and E the
    absolute electric field.}
  \label{tab:mobility_parameters}
  \begin{tabular}{c c c c}
    \toprule
    Parameter & Electrons & Holes & unit \\
    \midrule

    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\cref{fig:Mobility_electron_holes} shows the mobility for
electrons and holes as a function of the electric field. For a low electric field, the mobility for intrinsic silicon at 300~K
is:
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{aligned}
    \mu_n=1415 \pm 46 \qquad \textnormal{\cmsquared/(Vs)} \; , \\
    \mu_p=480 \pm 17 \qquad \textnormal{\cmsquared/(Vs)} \; .
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}

Holes are three times less mobile than electrons which make them more
likely to be trapped in an irradiated material.

\subsection{Introduction to TCAD: TO DO}
%% --------------------------------------------- %%
\section{Pixel detectors: pn-junction}

Silicon sensors are made of reversely biased pn-junctions. The
electric field due to the bias voltage allows the charge carriers to
drift towards the readout chip and also to suppress the leakage current.

\subsection{pn-junction in thermal equilibrium}

The potential $\varphi$ at each point is described by Poisson's equation~\cref{eq:poisson} \cite{Knoll2010}
\begin{equation}
  \nabla^{2}  \varphi=-{\rho \over \epsilon}\; ,
  \label{eq:poisson}
\end{equation}

where $\epsilon$ is the dielectric constant of the medium and $\rho$ the net charge density.
The electric field E due to the electric potential is obtained by \cref{eq:Efield}

\begin{equation}
E=-grad \varphi \; ,
\label{eq:Efield}
\end{equation}

In one dimension, \cref{eq:poisson} becomes
\begin{equation}
{{d^{2}  \varphi(z)} \over {dz^{2}}}=-{\rho(z) \over \epsilon}\; ,
\label{eq:poisson1D}
\end{equation}

To simplify, we assume an abrupt junction where the charge densities on the p and n sides are:
\begin{equation}
  \rho(z)= 
  \begin{cases} 
    eN_{D}, & \mbox{if } 0\leq z < z_{n}\\ 
    -eN_{A}, & \mbox{if } z_{p}\leq z < 0 
  \end{cases} 
  \; ,
\label{eq:chargeDensity}
\end{equation}

First, considering the n-side, the first and second integrations of the Poisson equation give,
\begin{equation}
    {{d\phi(z)} \over {dz}}=-{{eN_{d}} \over \epsilon} (z-z_{n}) 
    \; ,
    \label{eq:PoissonIntegration1}
  \end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  \phi(z)=-{{eN_{d}} \over \epsilon} {z^{2} \over 2}+{{eN_{d}zz_{n}}\over \epsilon}+Vj
  \; ,
  \label{eq:PoissonIntegration2}
\end{equation}

Where $V_j$ is the potential at the interface where the n- and the p-sides join. At the boundary of the depletion region $z=z_{n}$:

\begin{equation}
  \phi(z_{n})=V_{b}={{eN_{d}z_{n}^{2}} \over \epsilon}+V_j 
  \; ,
  \label{eq:BounderyPotential}
\end{equation}

In the p-region,
\begin{equation}
  V_j={{eN_ax_p^2} \over {2\epsilon}}
  \; ,
\end{equation}

And the total potential,
\begin{equation}
V_b={{e} \over {2 \epsilon}}(N_dx_n^2+N_ax_p^2)
  \; ,
\end{equation}

The overall charge neutrality is maintained,
\begin{equation}
N_d x_n=N_a x_p
  \; ,
\end{equation},

the reverse bias potential can be expressed as

\begin{equation}
V_b={e \over {2\epsilon}}\left(1+{N_a \over N_d}\right) N_a x_p^2={e \over {2\epsilon}}\left(1+{N_d \over N_a}\right) N_d x_n^2
  \; .
\end{equation}

The depletion widths on the n- and p-sides of the junction are

\begin{equation}
  \begin{multlined}
x_n=\sqrt{{2 \epsilon V_b} \over {eN_d(1+N_d/N_a)}} \\
x_p=\sqrt{{2 \epsilon V_b} \over {eN_a(1+N_a/N_d)}} 
\; ,
\end{multlined}
\end{equation}

The total depletion width is 

\begin{equation}
W=x_n+x_p=\sqrt{{2 \epsilon V_b \left(N_a+N_d\right)} \over {eN_aN_d} }
\; ,
\end{equation}

The junction potential and also for an asymmetrical junction with $N_d \ll N_a$ for which the junction potential is equal to the potential of the p-contact.

\begin{equation}
V_j=\left(N_d \over N_a\right) {V_b \over \left(  1+N_d/N_a \right)} \stackrel{N_d \ll N_a}{\approx} {N_d \over N_a}V_b
\; ,
\end{equation}


For a pixel detector with asymmetric junction with a highly doped surface $N_c$ concentration and a lightly doped bulk $N_b$ ($N_b \ll N_c$), the doping concentration is expressed in terms of resistivity 
\begin{equation}
\rho_b = {1 \over {e\mu_{b}N_{b}}}
\; ,
\end{equation}
where $\mu_b$ and $N_b$ are the mobility and the doping concentration of the bulk. The depletion width $W$ becomes,
\begin{equation}
W=\sqrt{2 \epsilon \mu_b \rho_bV_b}
\; ,
\label{eq:depletionWidth}
\end{equation}

In the absence of an externally applied voltage to a pn-junction, the
thermal diffusion of the electrons and the holes from their original
atoms results in a depletion width with a potential difference between
the p- and n-sides called the built-in potential $V_{bi}$ which is
about 0.5~V for detector diodes. \\

\subsection{Reverse bias}
By taking into account the built-in reverse bias voltage, \cref{eq:depletionWidth} is written as,
\begin{equation}
W=\sqrt{2 \epsilon \mu_b \rho_b \left(V_b+V_{bi}\right)}=\sqrt{{2 \epsilon \left(V_b+V_{bi}\right)} \over {eN_b}}
\; ,
\label{eq:depletionWidth2}
\end{equation}

The electric field of \cref{eq:PoissonIntegration1}, by replacing the depletion width and $N_d$ by \cref{eq:depletionWidth2} can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
E(z)={{2\left(V_b+V_{bi}\right)} \over {W}} \left({z \over W}-1\right)
\; ,
\end{equation}

The depletion voltage ($W=d$) can be expressed as,
\begin{equation}
V_D={{eN_bd^2} \over {2 \epsilon}}-V_{bi}
\; ,
\label{eq:depletionVoltage}
\end{equation}
where $d$ is the detector thickness. \\

The electric field drops linearly from its maximum value at the junction to zero at the opposite contact. Increasing the bias voltage beyond the needed bias to completely deplete the detector adds a uniform field. By neglecting the built-in voltage (as the bias voltage is much higher than that), the electric field is written as,
\begin{equation}
E(z)={{V_B-V_D} \over d}+\left(1-{z \over d}\right)2{V_D \over d}
\; ,
\label{eq:Efield}
\end{equation}

The charge carriers, drift through the silicon detector with a velocity as defined by,

\begin{equation}
  \vec{v}_{drift}=\mu_c \cdot \vec{E}\; ,
\end{equation}

In one-dimension, and considering $\mu_c$ constant, the drift velocity is written as
\begin{equation}
v_{drift}={{dz} \over {dt}}=\mu_c \cdot E(z)
\; ,
\end{equation}

The time required for a charge originating at point $z_0$ to reach a point $z$ is
\begin{equation} 
  t(z)=\int_{z_0}^{z} {{ds} \over {\mu_c \cdot E(s)}}
  \; ,
  \label{eq:driftTimeIntegral}
\end{equation}

By integrating \cref{eq:driftTimeIntegral} and replacing the electric field by \cref{eq:Efield} one obtains:

\begin{equation} 
  t(z, z_0)={{d^2} \over {2 \mu_c V_D}} ln\left( {{d(V_B+V_D)-2V_Dz_0} \over {d(V_B+V_D)-2V_Dz}} \right)
  \; ,
  \label{eq:driftTimeIntegratedz0}
\end{equation}

In \cref{eq:driftTimeIntegratedz0}, by replacing $z_0=0$, we obtain:
\begin{equation} 
  t(z)={{d^2} \over {2 \mu_c V_D}} ln\left( {{V_B+V_D} \over {V_B+V_D-2V_Dz/d}} \right)
  \; ,
  \label{eq:driftTimeIntegrated}
\end{equation}

And the diffusion standard deviation is given by,

\begin{equation} 
  \sigma_{diffusion}\left(z\right)=\sqrt{2 D_{b} t_{c}}=\sqrt{{{kTd^2}\over{eV_D}}ln\left({{V_B+V_D}\over{V_B+V_D-2V_Dz/d}}\right)}
  \; ,
  \label{eq:driftTimeIntegrated}
\end{equation}


The drift time depends on the charge carrier as shown in
\cref{eq:driftTimeIntegrated}. \cref{fig:Drift_n_vs_p} compares the
drift time for n and p-type carriers in a $50\,\micron$ thick silicon
sensor with a depletion voltage of |V\textsubscript{D}|=4~V and biased
at |V\textsubscript{B}|=15~V as a function of the depth. The electrons
have a higher drift time and therefore are faster for readout. But
diffusion does not depend on the carrier.

\cref{fig:Efield_n_vs_p} shows the electric field and the mobility
distribution as a function of the depth in silicon.

\section{Spatial resolution}

The spatial resolution of a pixel detector is mainly determined by the pixel
pitch. But this can be improved by the readout choice (binary or
analog), the threshold value, the charge sharing, thickness of the
detector and the reconstruction algorithm. The effect of the readout
is studied in the sections here-below.

The spatial resolution is defined by:
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{position}^2={{\int_{-p/2}^{p/2} \left(x_r-x_m\right)^2
    D\left(x_r\right) dx_r } \over { \int_{-p/2}^{p/2}
    D\left(x_r\right) dx_r }}\; ,
\label{eq:spatialRes}
\end{equation}

where $\sigma_{position}$ is the average distance between the real
impact position $x_r$ and the measured position $x_m$ of the
particle in a pixel.

In the coming sections, the spatial resolution defined by
\cref{eq:spatialRes} is calculated and studied for different scenarios
and assumptions.

\subsection{Binary readout}
The simplest case for the resolution computation is to consider a
binary readout with single threshold. For a pixel centered at 0 and
having a pitch $p$ with a probability density function as illustrated
in \cref{fig:SpatResBinary}, the following assumptions are considered:

\begin{itemize}
\item The threshold is adjusted in a way to fire one pixel per
  particle track.
\item Only hit positions between $-p/2$ and $p/2$ trigger a signal in
  pixel 0.
\item A uniform density of particles hit the detector ($D\left(x\right)=1$).
\end{itemize}


The average difference between the real position ($x_r$) and the
measured position ($x_m=0$) of the particle in a pixel is calculated
using \cref{eq:spatialRes} \cite{Rossi:976471}:
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{position}^2={{\int_{-p/2}^{p/2} \left(x_r\right)^2
    1 dx_r } \over { \int_{-p/2}^{p/2}
    1 dx_r }}={p^2 \over 12} \; ,
\label{eq:spatialResBinary}
\end{equation}
which results in a spatial resolution of:
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{position}={p \over \sqrt{12}} \;.
\label{eq:sigmapos}
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[htbp]

    \end{scope}
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{Binary readout}  
  \label{fig:SpatResBinary}
\end{figure}

This simple model shows the worst resolution achieved and is only
dependent on the pitch size (geometry of the pixels). In reality, with
charge sharing, the signal of a particle track is shared between
several pixels and depending on the readout threshold more than one
pixel can be fired which is called a \textit{cluster} of pixels. The
resolution is therefore improved as described in
\cref{sec:resolutionBinarySharing,sec:resolutionAnalogSharing}.

\subsection{Binary readout and charge sharing}\label{sec:resolutionBinarySharing}
The threshold of the readout electronics is usually set as low as
possible which can result in more than one pixel hit per particle
track. In this case, the charge is shared between two or more pixels
(cluster). Multi-hit clusters improve the resolution of
\cref{eq:spatialResBinary}. \cref{fig:SpatResBinaryChargeSharing}
illustrates the charge sharing between two pixels. If a track passes
close to the edge of a pixel (within a distance of $s\over 2$ close to
the edge), then the neighbouring pixel is also fired. For events
triggering single-hit events, the spatial resolution in pixel 0 for
1-hit clusters is given by:

\begin{equation}
\sigma_{position}^2={{\int_{-(p/2-s/2)}^{(p/2-s/2)} \left(x_r\right)^2
    1 dx_r } \over { \int_{-(p/2-s/2)}^{(p/2-s/2)}
    1 dx_r }}={(p-s)^2 \over 12} \; .
\label{eq:spatialResCharge sharing_1hit}
\end{equation}

For two-hit clusters, the spatial resolution is given by
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{position}={s \over \sqrt{12}} \; .
\label{eq:spatialResChargeSharing_2hit}
\end{equation}

The average resolution considering single and multi-hit clusters is given by
\begin{equation}
{\sigma_{\text{Total}}}^{2}={{\left(p-s\right)^{2}} \over 12}+{{s^2}\over12} \; .
\label{eq:spatialResChargeSharingTotal}
\end{equation}

The optimal average spatial resolution is obtained for $s=p/2$ as
shown in \cref{fig:sigmaTotal} where the pitch is
$p=55\,\micron$. This means that the number of single-hit and
multi-hit clusters is the same. But, in this situation one is not able
to distinguish between one track triggering two pixels and two tracks
hitting the sensor within $2p$.

    \cref{eq:spatialResChargeSharingTotal} with a pixel pitch of
    $p=55\,\micron$ where $s$ is the width of the charge sharing
    region as shown in \cref{fig:SpatResBinaryChargeSharing}.}
  \label{fig:sigmaTotal}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Analog readout and charge sharing}\label{sec:resolutionAnalogSharing}
The spatial resolution can be improved more when an analog readout is
used that delivers a signal proportional to the collected charge as
illustrated in \cref{fig:SpatResAnaglogChargeSharing}. In this
case, for multi-hit clusters $\eta$-function as described
in~\cite{Belau:1983eh} is used to reconstruct the hit position within
the pixels. 
In the region where only one pixel fires, the resolution is still
limited to $(p-s)\over \sqrt{12}$.

The charge carriers follow the field lines to end-up on a certain
electrode. They are also subject to thermal diffusion which spreads
the charge cloud as it drifts through the silicon. The width of the
diffusion $\sigma_{diffusion}(z)$ (for simplicity called $\sigma(z)$) at depth $z$ is given by
\cref{eq:driftTimeIntegrated}.
The charge distribution at position $x_{hit}$ for a pixel extending from
$x_1$ to $x_2$ is:
\begin{equation}
Q(x_{hit}, z)= Q(z) {1\over{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma^2(z)}}}
{\int_{x_1}^{x_2} e^{-({{x-x_{hit}}\over{\sqrt{2} \sigma(z)}})^2} } dx\; .
\label{eq:ChargeDistribution}
\end{equation}

By integrating \cref{eq:ChargeDistribution} over the whole
thickness of the detector, the charge deposited in a pixel at
coordinate $x_{hit}$ having coordinates $x_1$ and $x_2$ is given by:  
\begin{equation}
Q(x_{hit})= \int_{x_1}^{x_2}  \int_{0}^{d} {Q(z) \over {\sqrt{2 \pi
      \sigma^2(z)}} } e^{-({{x-x_{hit}}\over{\sqrt{2} \sigma(z)}})^2}
  dz \; dx\; .
\label{eq:ChargeDistribution_integrated_z}
\end{equation}

\section{Charge collection and Ramo's theorem: induced charge}
When a charge moves in the sensitive volume of a detector, a current
$i_s(t)$ flows instantaneously. \\ 
First, consider the simple example of a charge $q$ near an infinitely
large electrode with all the electric field lines terminating on the
electrode. The Gauss's law, for a surface $S$ surrounding the charge
is expressed as

\begin{equation}
\oint_{s} \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{a}=q\; .
\label{eq:GaussLaw}
\end{equation}

The induced charge obtained by integrating over a Gaussian surface
enclosing only the electrode is $-q$. \\
Considering two parallel electrodes with a charge $q$ in between as
showin in \cref{fig:InducedCharge_parallelPlates}. If the charge
is placed midway between the two parallel plates, it induces equal
charge of $-q/2$ on the both electrodes as half of the electric field
lines end up on the higher and the other half on the lower
electrode. When the charge moves towards the closer to a plate rather
than the other, the induced charge will be higher for the closer
plate. \\
The induced charge can not be observed directly but its change can be
measured when the two electrodes are connected in a closed circuit
(like a pixel detector) as it produces an induced current.

  \caption{The charge induced on two parallel plates depending on the
    position of the charge $q$. From~\cite{Spieler2005}.}
  \label{fig:InducedCharge_parallelPlates}
\end{figure}

Ramo's theorem~\cite{Ramo:1939vr} describes the time evolution of the induced current
created in a detector. The induced current on the electrodes is
described as a function of the weighting potential $\Phi$ which
describes the coupling of a charge to an electrode. \\
The weighting potential is defined for a specific electrode. It is
obtained by setting the potential of the electrode to 1 and setting
all other electrodes to potential 0. \cref{eq:RamoCharge}
describes the induced charge $Q_k$ on electrode $k$ if a charge q moves along
any path from position $z_0$ to $z_p$.
\begin{equation}
    Q_{k}=q \cdot [\Phi_k(z_p)-\Phi_k(z_0)] \; .
   \label{eq:RamoCharge} 
  \end{equation}

 It is important to note that the weighting potential (field) is
 different than the electric potential (field). The electric field
 determines the drift trajectory and velocity of the charge carriers
 whereas the weighting field depends only on the geometry of the
 electrodes and defines how the charge motion induces a charge to a
 specific electrode. In the specific case of two-electrode configuration the
 electric and the weighting fields are the same. \\
In a TCAD simulation~\cite{synopsysTCAD}, the weighting field and potential are obtained
as shown in \cref{fig:RamoTCAD}. For this study the silicon
sensor has a thickness of 200~\micron and is over-depleted with a bias
voltage of \SI{50}{\volt} on the back-side. First, \SI{0}{\volt} is
applied to all the electrodes and then \SI{1}{\volt} is applied to the
electrode~$k$. By taking the difference between the two
configurations, the weighting potential and field are obtained.

\end{figure}

The weighting potential for different positions on the
x-axis is shown in \cref{fig:RamoTCADCuts}. Since, the total
charge collected by the electrode $k$ depends only on the positions
$z_0$ and $z_p$, in the absence of the radiation-induced damages
(which would affect the distributions of the electric and weighting
fields), the Ramo theorem can be neglected.
