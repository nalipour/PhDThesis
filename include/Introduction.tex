The Compact Linear Collider (CLIC)~\cite{Linssen:1425915} concept for
a future linear e\textsuperscript{+}e\textsuperscript{-} collider has
the potential to complement the measurements done by the LHC
experiments. With proposed centre-of-mass energies of $380\,\gev$,
$1.5\,\tev$ and $3\,\tev$ and with instantaneous luminosity up to
$6\times10^{34}\,\inversecmsquaredsec$, it allows for high precision
measurements of Standard Model physics and of new physics potentially
discovered at the $13\,\tev$ LHC. 

A detector model is being developed for the CLIC experiment taking
into account the precision physics requirements and experimental
conditions. These conditions set challenging demands for the vertex
detector in terms of spatial resolution, material budget, timing
resolution and efficient heat removal from sensors and readout. The
CLIC vertex detector R\&D programme studies different sensor
technologies and takes into account constraints from mechanics, power
delivery and cooling.  The goal is to achieve a single-point
resolution of $3\,\micron$ with $50\,\micron$ thick sensors coupled to
$50\,\micron$ thick readout ASICs with $25\,\micron$ pixel pitch.

In this thesis, the feasibility of thin sensors for operation for the
CLIC vertex detector is studied with the
Timepix3~\cite{Timepix3Poikela} readout chips with a pixel size of
$55\,\micron$. Test beam data for different sensor thicknesses is
compared to \textsc{Geant4}-based~\cite{Agostinelli:2002hh}
simulations to validate the simulations. The simulation is
extrapolated for smaller pixels of $25\,\micron$.

In order to reduce the multiple scatterings and achieve high precision
on measurements, a low material budget of
$\sim0.2\%$~X\textsubscript{0} per vertex detector layer is required
including readout, support and cabling. Active-edge sensors allow for
seamless tiling of pixel sensors of a vertex detector by depleting the
sensors up to their physical edges. This allows for high coverage
without creating overlaps between the pixel sensors and therefore
reduces the material. Different guard ring solutions for thin
active-edge sensors are considered for the CLIC vertex
detector. Prototypes have been characterised with measurements and
simulations and an optimal solution is proposed.

This thesis is structured as following. \cref{ch:CLIC} describes the
CLIC experiment. The accelerator is briefly introduced and the
requirements on the CLIC detector, with a focus on the vertex
detector, are given. The flavour-tagging performance is studied for
different geometries of the vertex detector.

Principles of the semiconductor detectors are presented in
\cref{sec:SiliconTheory} as this thesis focuses on the R\&D of the
vertex detector.

The Timepix3 readout ASIC is presented in
\cref{ch:FE_electronics}. The assemblies tested are introduced and
their readout noise is as well studied. The calibration methods for
these assemblies are discussed.

The simulation and reconstruction software frameworks are described in
\cref{sec:Software}. The simulations are later validated with
data. The reconstruction frameworks are used for the analysis of both
simulations and data.

The Timepix3 pixel-beam telescope used for the testing of the Timepix3
assemblies is described in \cref{ch:Telescope}. Its performance is
investigated in data and simulations.

The feasibility and performance of thin sensors is studied in
\cref{ch:ThinSensorsStudies}. Simulations are validated with test-beam
data. The spatial resolution for a $25\,\micron$ pitch with a
$50\,\micron$ thick pixel detector is extrapolated using the
simulations.

The performance of active-edge sensors is discussed in
\cref{ch:ActiveEdgeSensors}. Different designs for the guard ring are
considered. Test-beam results are compared to TCAD simulations.

% CLICpix~\cite{clicpix}, a readout ASIC with $25\,\micron$
% pixel pitch, is developed in 65~nm CMOS technology. CLICpix is either
% bump bonded to planar silicon sensors or capacitively coupled through a thin
% layer of glue to active sensors implemented in a commercial 180~nm
% High-Voltage (HV) CMOS process~\cite{AlipourTehrani:2048684}.  Results of
