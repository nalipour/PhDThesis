%============================================================================== 
Accelerator (two-beam acceleration), CLIC detector concept, picture of
the full detector (3 pages)

\section{Requirements for the CLIC vertex detector}
motivation for pixel detectors in high-energy physics (flavour-tagging
plots), requirements, design, technical challenges
(cooling/mechanics), Beam induced backgrounds, Radiation damage in the
vertex detector (3 pages).


\section{Flavour tagging at CLIC}
say motivation of this thesis $\Rightarrow$ provide input for the
digitiser (1 page) and the detector simulation software.
